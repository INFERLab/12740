title: 2. Setting up Your First Sensor and Actuator

In this tutorial, we will

- Introduce you to **general-purpose input/outputÂ (GPIO) pins** on the RPi.
- Teach you how to connect simple circuits with breadboard.
- Guide you to set up your first sensor and actuator, and interface with them using Python script. *(For those of you who are not familiar with Python programming, you may want to refer to online resources, such as [this](https://www.learnpython.org/), to get started.)*

The content of this tutorial elaborates on the information in **pp. 7-11 from the Quick-Start Guide**.

**Be sure to shut down and disconnect from power source when you are making connections between the GPIO pins and your circuit.** 

### GPIO Pins
The GPIO pins are the interface with sensors and actuators. Note that GPIO pins only relay digital signals, i.e. the pins only input / output two states, high or low. In this tutorial, we will work with sensors / actuators with binary states. In the next tutorial, we will show you how to interface with analog signals.  

The kit comes with a **GPIO Header Quick Reference Card**, which corresponds to the RPi as shown below:

To make things easier, the kit comes with a breakout board and a ribbon cable. Connect the GPIO pins to the breadboard with the ribbon cable and breakout board, like this:

Now, you can develop your circuit on the breadboard alone! 

### Breadboard
For those of you who have not worked with breadboard before, the figure below shows how the tie-points are connected. The <span style="color:blue">some **Red** text</span> columns are connected to the power. The <span style="color:blue">some **Blue** text</span> columns are connected to the ground. The <span style="color:blue">some **Green** text</span> rows are inter-connected, except for gap in the middle.

## Control an LED with a Timer

- Set up the circuit following **p. 9 on the Quick-Start Guide**. The circuit should look like this. 
- Input the following code with Thonny Python IDE.


```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

red_led = 18

GPIO.setup(red_led, GPIO.OUT)

while True:
    GPIO.output(red_led, GPIO.HIGH)
    time.sleep(3)
    GPIO.output(red_led, GPIO.LOW)
    time.sleep(1)
```

- Alternatively, all the sample codes used for tutorials in this course are available at this [Github Repository](https://github.com/chenbq1234/12740_code). You may download the repository to your local path. 
- Finally, run the Python script. You can run it with either the IDE or the terminal. To execute in the terminal, use the cd command to go to where the Python scripts are stored and use `python fileName.py` to execute the script.  
```
$ cd /path/to/python/script
$ python fileName.py
``` 
- Note that there is not a termination condition in the script, so it will run indefinitely. Press `ctrl+c` on the keyboard to terminate the process. 

## Control the LED with a Button
Now, instead of controlling the LED with a timer, we will add a button into the circuit. 

- Set up the circuit following **p. 9 on the Quick-Start Guide**. The circuit should look like this. 
- Input the following code with Python IDE.


## Version Control with Git
To collaborate with your teammates, you may want to use version control for your codes. Read this [Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to create your own repository and learn how to manage your codes among the team.
