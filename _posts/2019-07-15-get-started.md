Each project team will get the following items.

- Raspberry Pi 4 Ultimate Kit from CanaKit
- Smart Home Sensor Kit
- DisplayPort to HDMI Adaptor


## Step 0: Open your Raspberry Pi (RPI) 4 kit
For this tutorial, you will only need the RPi kit and the DisplayPort to HDMI Adaptor. In additional to that, you will need a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse, which are available in our computer lab.

**Since the kits will be used by future students, please make sure to keep your kit in good condition**.  
 
The kit includes the following items. In particular, the kit comes with a **Quick-Start Guide**, which supplements this tutorial.  

- Raspberry Pi 4 (4 GB RAM)
- CanaKit USB-C Power Supply
- Set of 3 Aluminum Heat Sinks
- CanaKit Quick-Start Guide
- SanDisk 32GB MicroSD w/NOOBS
- Premium Black Case
- USB Card Reader
- Micro HDMI Cable

- GPIO and Resistor Colors Quick Reference Cards
- GPIO Ribbon Cable
- Full-Size Large Breadboard
- 32 x M/M Jumper Wires
- RGB LED
- 2 x Red LEDs
- 2 x Green LEDs
- 2 x Yellow LEDs
- 2 x Blue LEDs
- 2 x Push Button Switches
- 10 x 220 Ohm Resistors
- 5 x 10K Ohm Resistors

## Step 1: Install Heat Sinks and Fit the RPi in the Case
-Firstly, stick the heat sinks onto the RPi following the instructions on p. 3 of the **Quick-Start Guide**.

-Fit the RPi in the case that comes with the kit.

Step 2: Insert the SD Card
-Insert the SD card directly into the RPi. The SD card that comes with the kit is already pre-loaded with a New Out of Box Software (NOOBS), which is an operating system (OS) installation manager for RPi's.   

Step 3: Connect your RPi 
-Connect a monitor to the RPi. The monitors in the computer lab use DisplayPort interface, so we provide you with a DisplayPort to HDMI adaptor. Use the micro HDMI cable that comes with the kit to connect the monitor to Port HDMI0 on the RPi.
-Connect a mouse and a keyboard to the RPi.
-Finally, connect the power adaptor that comes with the kit.

Step 4: 
-
-Install Raspbian OS and configure your RPi following the on-screen instructions. 

For WiFi connection, select "CMU-DEVICE". You need to open the web browser to register your device, using your CMU credential. 

Restart the Rpi following the on-screen instruction. 

(Optional) Step 5: Enable remote access of Rpi
