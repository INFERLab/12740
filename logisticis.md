#### Project Report
For project report, you will create a Github webpage following the template [here](/12740/tutorials/template.html). You should also refer to [past projects](http://wiki.marioberges.com/courses/12-740/index.php?title=Main_Page). The template only serves as a guideline on the content to include in your report. You are free to take artistic license in designing your project webpage.

Refer to the documentation [here](https://pages.github.com) on how to create your own Github webpage. You will create the project webpage with your own Github repository. 

To encourage working on your project early, we will check your progress before TA assistance sessions. Each group should send a link of their project webpage to the TA by September 30. We acknowledge that it is work-in-progress. But, the progress report should include motivation of the problem, some preliminary works, and problems encountered. The progress report will be graded on a binary basis, that is you will get full credits as long as you demonstrate	that you have been working on the project and document it properly.  

#### Project Video
The final video submission should be uploaded [here](https://vimeo.com/groups/609557).
