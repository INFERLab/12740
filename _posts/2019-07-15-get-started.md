Each project team will get the following items.

- Raspberry Pi 4 Ultimate Kit from CanaKit
- Smart Home Sensor Kit

Accessories:
- DisplayPort to HDMI Adaptor

## Step 0: Open your Raspberry Pi (RPi) 4 Kit
For this tutorial, you will only need the RPi kit and the DisplayPort to HDMI Adaptor. In additional to that, you will need a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse, which are available in our computer lab. 


**Since the kits will be used by future students, please make sure to keep your kit in good condition**.

The RPi kit includes the following items. In particular, the kit comes with a **Quick-Start Guide**. Read pp. 2-4 of the **Quick-Start Guide**, which supplements this tutorial.

- Raspberry Pi 4 (4 GB RAM)
- CanaKit USB-C Power Supply
- Set of 3 Aluminum Heat Sinks
- CanaKit Quick-Start Guide
- SanDisk 32GB MicroSD w/NOOBS
- Premium Black Case
- USB Card Reader
- Micro HDMI Cable

Accessories:
- GPIO and Resistor Colors Quick Reference Cards
- GPIO Ribbon Cable
- Full-Size Large Breadboard
- 32 x M/M Jumper Wires
- RGB LED
- 2 x Red LEDs
- 2 x Green LEDs
- 2 x Yellow LEDs
- 2 x Blue LEDs
- 2 x Push Button Switches
- 10 x 220 Ohm Resistors
- 5 x 10K Ohm Resistors

## Step 1: Install Heat Sinks and Fit the RPi in the Case

- Firstly, stick the heat sinks onto the RPi following the instructions on p. 3 of the **Quick-Start Guide**.
- Fit the RPi in the case that comes with the kit.

## Step 2: Insert the SD Card
- Insert the SD card directly into the RPi. The SD card that comes with the kit is already pre-loaded with a New Out of Box Software (NOOBS), which is an operating system (OS) installation manager for RPi's. So, there is no need for you to do anything with the SD card.

## Step 3: Connect your RPi 
- Connect a monitor to the RPi. Use the micro HDMI cable that comes with the kit to connect the monitor to Port HDMI 0 on the RPi. The monitors in the computer lab use DisplayPort interface, so we additionally provide you with a DisplayPort to HDMI adaptor.
- Connect a mouse and a keyboard to the RPi.
- Finally, connect the power adaptor that comes with the kit. 


## Step 4: Install OS for your RPi
- The RPi should power up automatically, after you connect the RPi to the power adaptor.
- Install Raspbian OS and configure your RPi following the on-screen instructions. 
- For WiFi connection, use "CMU-DEVICE". You need to open the web browser to register the RPi using your CMU credential. 
- Finally, restart the RPi following the on-screen instruction. 



## **Congratulations! You have successfully set up your RPi.**

## *(Optional)* Step 5: Set Up Remote Access to RPi
After you finish with Step 1-4, your desk probably looks like this:

If you do not want the clutter and you are comfort with command line tools, you should [set up remote access to your RPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/ssh-remote-control-raspberry-pi/). Having set up the remote access, you can do without the monitor, keyboard and mouse, and work on the RPi directly from your laptop.
