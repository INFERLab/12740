In this tutorial, we will:
- Familiarize you with the sensors.
- Show you how to translate analog signals from sensors to digital signals using an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).

### Sensor Kit
Having introduced you to the basics of RPi, we will look at how to acquire information from physical world using sensors. We provide each team with a **Smart Home Sensor Kit** from Kookye. Kookye has a comprehensive list of [tutorials](http://kookye.com/2016/08/01/smart-home-sensor-kit-for-arduinoraspberry-pi/) for the sensor kit.

Without knowing the specifics, the label on each leg of a sensor module gives you a pretty good idea of what it is meant for and how to connect it in the circuit.   

| **Labels on the Legs**      | **Meaning**     |
| ------------- | ---------------------|
| VCC, +    | Power Input |       
| GND, -    | Ground      | 
|AO         |Analog Output|
|DO         |Digital Output|
|S, SIG, DATA, OUT |Signal|

### MCP3008
The GPIO pins on RPi only take digital signals. However, signals from some sensors come in analog form. In such cases, we will use an ADC to translate the signal. We will use **MCP3008** that comes with the sensor kit for this tutorial. 

**MCP3008** can process 8 channels of analog input with 10-bit precision. The numberings of the pins are shown below. When you read the pin numbers, be sure to align the notch on the microchip with the one in the figure. For more details, see the [MCP3008 Spec Sheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/MCP3008.pdf).

CH0-CH7 pins (Pins 1-8) are used for the analog inputs from sensors. Connect the rest of the pins to corresponding pins on the RPi with jump wires. 

| **MCP3008**      | **RPi**     |
| ------------- | ---------------------|
| VDD (Pin 16)    | 3.3V|       
|   VREF (Pin 15) | 3.3V     | 
| AGND (Pin 14)   | GROUND |
|   CLK (Pin 13) |SCLK|
|DOUT (Pin 12)|MISO|
|DIN (Pin 11)|MOSI|
|CS (Pin 10)| CE0|
|DGND (Pin 9) |GROUND|


### Adding a Sensor Module
In this tutorial, we will use the **Photosensitive Light Sensor Module**. But, the process  is similar for any sensor module. Connect the sensor module following the table. Note that  the sensor module comes with both analog output (AO) and digital output (DO). We will connect the AO to the ADC and the DO directly to the RPi for a comparison. 
 
| **Sensor Module**      |      |
| ------------- | ---------------------|
| VCC  | 3.3V|       
|   GND | GROUND     | 
| AO   | MCP3008 CH0 (Pin 1) |
|   DO | RPi 21|
