In this tutorial, we will:
- Familiarize you with the sensor kit.
- Show you how to translate analog signals to digital signals using an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).

### Sensor Kit
Having introduced you to the basics of RPi, we will look at how to acquire information from physical world using sensors. We provide each team with a **Smart Home Sensor Kit** from Kookye. Kookye provides a comprehensive list of [tutorials](http://kookye.com/2016/08/01/smart-home-sensor-kit-for-arduinoraspberry-pi/) for the sensors in the kit.

The label on each leg should give you a good idea of it should be used for.  

| **Labels on the Legs**      | **Meaning**     |
| ------------- | ---------------------|
| VCC, +    | Power Input |       
| GND, -    | Ground      | 
|AO         |Analog Output|
|DO         |Digital Output|
|S, SIG, DATA, OUT |Signal|

### MCP3008
The GPIO pins on RPi only take digital signals. However, signals from sensors are often analog.
