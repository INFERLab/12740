title: 2. Setting up Your First Sensor and Actuator

In this tutorial, we will

- Introduce you to **general-purpose input/outputÂ (GPIO) pins** on the RPi.
- Teach you how to connect simple circuits with breadboard.
- Guide you to set up your first sensor and actuator, and interface with them using Python script. *(For those of you who are not familiar with Python programming, you may want to refer to online resources, such as [this](https://www.learnpython.org/), to get started.)*

The content of this tutorial elaborates on the information in **pp. 7-11 from the Quick-Start Guide**.

**Be sure to shut down the RPi and disconnect it from power source when you are making connections between the GPIO pins and your circuit.** 

### GPIO Pins
The GPIO pins are the interface with sensors and actuators. Note that GPIO pins only relay digital signals, i.e. the pins only input / output **HIGH** or **LOW**. In this tutorial, we will work with sensors / actuators with binary states. In the next tutorial, we will show you how to interface with analog signals.  

The kit comes with a **GPIO Header Quick Reference Card**, which corresponds to the physical header on the RPi as shown below:

To make things easier, the kit comes with a breakout board and a ribbon cable. Connect the GPIO pins to the breadboard using the ribbon cable and breakout board, like this:

Now, you can develop your circuit on the breadboard alone. No entangled wires any more!

### Breadboard
For those of you who have not worked with breadboard before, the figure below shows how the tie-points are connected. The <span style="color:red">**Red**</span> columns are connected to the power. The <span style="color:blue">**Blue**</span> columns are connected to the ground. The <span style="color:green">**Green**</span> rows are inter-connected, except for gap in the middle.

## Control an LED with a Timer
We will start by connecting an LED to the breadboard. The LED will blink following a timer.  

- Set up the circuit following **p. 9 on the Quick-Start Guide**. The circuit should look like this: 

![led](/12740/assets/LED.jpg)

- Type the following code into Thonny Python IDE that comes with the Raspbian OS. Alternatively, all the sample codes used for tutorials in this course are available at this [Github Repository](https://github.com/chenbq1234/12740_code). You may download the repository to your local path. 

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

red_led = 18

GPIO.setup(red_led, GPIO.OUT)

while True:
    GPIO.output(red_led, GPIO.HIGH)
    time.sleep(3)
    GPIO.output(red_led, GPIO.LOW)
    time.sleep(1)
```
- Finally, run the Python script. You may run it with either the IDE or the terminal. To execute in the terminal, use the cd command to go to where the Python scripts are stored and use `python fileName.py` to execute the script.  
```
$ cd /path/to/python/script
$ python fileName.py
``` 
- Note that there is not a termination condition in the script, so it will run indefinitely. Press `Ctrl+C` on the keyboard to terminate the process. 

## Control the LED with a Button
Now, we will use a physical button to control the LED.  

- Set up the circuit following **p. 10 on the Quick-Start Guide**. The circuit should look like this: 
![led](/12740/assets/LED_Button.jpg)
- You only need to modify a few line of codes to replace the timer with the button.  
```python
red_led = 18
button = 25

GPIO.setup(button, GPIO.IN)
GPIO.setup(red_led, GPIO.OUT)

while True:
    if GPIO.input(button):
        GPIO.output(red_led, GPIO.LOW)
    else:
        GPIO.output(red_led, GPIO.HIGH)
```
- One thing you may have noticed is that the LED stays in the last state when you terminate the process. That's because the GPIO pins do not automatically reset when you terminate the process. We can `GPIO.cleanup()` to restore the pins to their defaults states. Use the following code to catch "KeyBoardInterrupt", i.e. 'Ctrl+C', and reset pins before exiting the process. 
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        GPIO.cleanup()
        sys.exit(0)
```

The overall code looks like this:
```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time
import sys

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

red_led = 18
button = 25

GPIO.setup(button, GPIO.IN)
GPIO.setup(red_led, GPIO.OUT)

def main():
    while True:
        if GPIO.input(button):
            GPIO.output(red_led, GPIO.LOW)
        else:
            GPIO.output(red_led, GPIO.HIGH)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        GPIO.cleanup()
        sys.exit(0)
```
## Version Control with Git
To collaborate with your teammates, you may want to use version control for your codes. Read this [Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to create your own repository and learn how to manage your codes among the team.
